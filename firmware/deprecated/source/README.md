Due to excessive copyright violations by using the old source for commercial purposes
the authors were forced to remove public access to the sources. The project was changed 
to allow access to the source code for contributors only with version 2.0. If you like
to contribute please contact the authors at vpuniverse. 
Also a activation key which is bound to the hardware was introduced.
More Information how to obtain a key is here http://vpuniverse.com/forums/forum/132-pin2dmd/
